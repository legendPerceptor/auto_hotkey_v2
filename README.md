# Enhance Productivity on Windows with AutoHotkey

The script should be used with a macro keypad. I bought one from Temu with 16 custom keys and 3 audio knobs. The driver for this keypad can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kwzMXGfpaG2GczIoM-W8AYh1IxnVQRrE/view?usp=sharing). These types of products are discontinued quickly but any similar products should work.

I currently use the script mainly for instant app switching and Adobe Premiere Pro related enhanced shortcuts.
